# H1-B Sponsors Search:

Being an international student is hard. Besides having to study in a foreing language, most of us need to create a new network to find a job or intership, while there are many companies that don't sponsor international people.

To make life easier to international students, I developed a seamless tool to find the companies that sponsor H1-B visas for international students. You can search by State, Industry and company name.

## Final Thoughts

This is the first project working by myself in something that motivates me. I know there are many things to be improved, specially with data visualization. Since I've decided to only use AI assistants to yes/no questions and not to code critical parts of my projects, is that I'm planning to take a course of data visualization in the upcoming fall 2025 to improve this aspect of this project.

It was exciting to finally start creating my own projects and see how the skills I'm learning can be used to make people's lifes easier in some aspects.

I wish you enjoy this project, and hopefully, you can find an employer who can sponsor your H1-B visa.
