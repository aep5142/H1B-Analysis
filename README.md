# H1B-Analysis
This is a small project I'm working at to improve the skills of coding and data analysis I'm getting at the MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy of the University of Chicago.

The main goal is to quicly filter the top companies that sponsor H1-B in each state or through the US.
